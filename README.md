# project5

For this project I was tasked with making a GUI menu that could find the hamming distances of Strings.
The GUI must be able to do a few things.

1. The GUI must be able to read in Strings and add them to a list of pre-determined strings. These pre-determined strings are located
in the Mesonet file

2. The menu must be able to count up how many of the strings are a hamming distance of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 away

3. The menu must be able to display the strings that are 1, 2, 3, and 4 away.
